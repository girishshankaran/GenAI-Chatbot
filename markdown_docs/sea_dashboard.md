# SEA: Dashboard

>**Note**: Dashboard is only available to **SEA System Admin** or **SEA Access Admin users**. 

The Secure Equipment Access (SEA) Service provides a Dashboard that shows an aggregated view of the current status of all **Active Sessions**, **SEA Agents**, and **Access Control Groups**. It also displays trends of the remote sessions and data usage over time. The **SEA Dashboard** is designed to help the OT Admin to monitor key SEA data points and trends and react quickly to any problems. Click any of the **dashlets** to see more details.
