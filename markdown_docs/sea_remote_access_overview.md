# SEA remote access: overview

The SEA Remote Access screen provides customized views depending on your SEA role.

* As a user with **SEA User** role, you can only view **Remote Sessions** assigned to you.
* User(s) with **SEA System Admin** and **SEA Access Admin** roles can configure groups for access.
* If you are using SEA Plus as a remote access method, you must have downloaded and installed the **SEA Plus App** to your local machine and enabled **SEA Plus** (toggle switch top right corner) so that it shows **SEA Plus Online** to access using SEA Plus. (For information on installing SEA Plus, see [SEA Plus access method](../secure_equipment_access/sea_plus_access_method.md)
* To access an **SEA Remote Asset session** that has Duo integration, you must install **Duo** on your local machine. For more information, see [Duo integration with SEA Plus](../secure_equipment_access/duo_posture_checks.md).
