# Record Inline sessions

This Secure Equipment Access (SEA) feature allows you to record sessions for future use, such as auditing or educational purposes. Recordings are stored in your own storage space on AWS S3 using the retention policies for the recordings at this location. The SEA System or Access Admin can enforce the session recording start through the Access Group before an SEA user can access an OT Asset within the group. Recording begins when the user launches a session from a group which enforces recording. 

For more information on AWS S3, see [What is S3?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

## Prerequisites:

* AWS S3 bucket has been set up and integrated with Secure Equipment Access service. See <a href="#ConfigInline">Configure Inline recording.</a>
